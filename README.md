# Lunatic
## PHP router framework for web (MVP).

This repository is originally an exercice I realised to :
* solidify my Oriented-Object Programming knowledge and assets,
* reproduce by my self some [Symfony](https://symfony.com) features.

The reason I used PHP is that's a good language to build and manage complex software architecture, thanks the PSR's system of namespaces.

The particularity of Lunatic is the use of annotations to define routes of web controllers.

Frameworks like Symfony have even implemented this feature, but they don't use the same comments to generate the documentation of routes.

So the advantage of Lunatic could be it'll give developers the possibility to manage configuration and documentation together (the package is actually not completed for this behavior).
