# Lunatic
## PHP framework for web (MVP).

This repository is originally an exercice I realised to solidify my Oriented-Object Programming knowledge and assets.

The reason I used PHP is that's a good language to build and manage complex software architecture, thanks the PSR's system of namespaces.

The particularity of Lunatic is the use of annotations to define routes of web controllers.

Others frameworks like [Symfony](https://symfony.com) have even implemented this feature, but they don't use the same comments to generate the documentation of routes.

So the idea behind Lunatic is to give developers the possibility to manage configuration and documentation together.
